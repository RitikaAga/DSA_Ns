//Insertion sort
// in insertion short we 1st compare 1st element to 2nd element    7 5 1 6 2
// if 1st elemnt is greater then we shift it to the right and 2nd elemnt take 1st element's place  5 7 1 6 2
// now we again check 3rd element 1st from 2nd then from 1
// if it is greator then the 1st element then it will take place of 1st element and 1st will shift to the 2nd index .  1 5 7 6 2 
// again it will check same this process would follow until the array will not short   1 2 5 6 7
// Tc = O(n) in best case O(n^2) in average and worst case
